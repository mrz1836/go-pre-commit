#  Setup MAGE-X Composite Action (GoFortress)
#
#  Purpose: Install and cache MAGE-X binary for use in GitHub Actions workflows.
#  Provides efficient caching by OS and version, with automatic installation on cache
#  miss and PATH management for seamless integration.
#
#  Features:
#    - Smart binary caching by OS and version
#    - Automatic installation only on cache miss
#    - PATH management for immediate availability
#    - Performance tracking outputs
#
#  Usage:
#    - uses: ./.github/actions/setup-magex
#      with:
#        magex-version: ${{ env.MAGE_X_VERSION }}
#        runner-os: ${{ runner.os }}
